        <h1>If someone has been bitten by a snake, here's a step-by-step guide for providing first aid:</h1>
    <h4>
        
         <br>
        1. **Stay Calm**: Both you and the victim should try to remain calm. Panic can increase the heart rate and spread the venom more quickly through the body.<br><br>
        
        2. **Move to Safety**: If the snake is still in the area, move away from it to avoid further bites. Ensure your own safety first.<br><br>
        
        3. **Keep the Affected Limb Still**: Immobilize the bitten limb as much as possible. This can slow the spread of venom through the bloodstream.<br><br>
        
        4. **Position**: Keep the affected limb at or slightly below the level of the heart to reduce blood flow to the area.<br><br>
        
        5. **Remove Constrictive Clothing or Jewelry**: If possible, remove any tight clothing or jewelry near the bite area. Swelling may occur, and constrictive items can impede circulation.<br><br>
        
        6. **Clean the Bite Area**: Wash the bite with soap and water if available. This can help reduce the risk of infection.<br><br>
        
        7. **Apply a Bandage**: Apply a clean, dry bandage over the bite site. The bandage should be snug, but not too tight, to help slow the spread of venom. Do not apply a tourniquet.<br><br>
        
        8. **Seek Medical Help Immediately**: Call emergency services or take the victim to the nearest medical facility as soon as possible. Provide details about the snake if known, but do not waste time trying to capture or kill the snake.<br><br>
        
        9. **Monitor Vital Signs**: While waiting for medical help to arrive, monitor the victim's vital signs, such as pulse and breathing. Be prepared to perform CPR if necessary.<br><br>
        
        10. **Do Not**: Do not try to suck out the venom, cut the wound, apply ice, or use a snakebite kit. These methods can be ineffective or even harmful.<br><br>
        
        Remember, the most important thing is to seek medical help promptly. Antivenom treatment may be necessary, and only medical professionals can administer it safely.<br><br>
