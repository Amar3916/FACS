    <h4>If someone gets bitten by a scorpion, here are the recommended first aid steps until they can receive medical attention:<br>
        <br>
        1. Stay calm and reassure the victim. Scorpion stings are rarely life-threatening, but they can be painful.<br>
        <br>
        2. Wash the affected area with soap and water to remove any remaining venom.<br>

        3. Apply a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a thin towel to the sting site. This can help reduce swelling and pain.<br>

        4. Immobilize the affected limb and keep it below the level of the heart if possible. This can help slow the spread of venom.<br>
        <br>
        5. Monitor the victim for signs of severe reaction, such as difficulty breathing, severe pain, muscle spasms, or slurred speech. These may indicate a more serious envenomation.
        <br><br>
        6. If the victim experiences any severe symptoms, call emergency services immediately.<br>
        <br>
        7. Do not apply a tourniquet, make any incisions, or attempt to remove venom by suction, as these measures are ineffective and may cause further harm.<br>
        <br>
        8. If the victim is stable, consider taking them to a hospital or medical facility for evaluation and possible treatment with antivenom, especially if the sting is from a highly venomous species.
        <br><br>
        9. Capture the scorpion safely, if possible, for identification purposes, as this can help with treatment.<br>
        <br>
        10. Monitor the victim's vital signs (breathing, pulse, blood pressure) and keep them calm until medical help arrives.<br>
        <br>
        The goal of first aid is to manage the symptoms, prevent the spread of venom, and seek prompt medical attention, especially for high-risk groups like children, the elderly, or those with underlying health conditions.</h4>
