        <h1> When severe burns occur, it's important to provide immediate first aid and seek medical attention promptly. Here's what you should do:</h1>
    <p>
       
        
       <br>

        1. *Ensure Safety*: Before approaching the burn victim, ensure that the area is safe and free from any ongoing danger, such as flames or electrical hazards. If it's safe to do so, extinguish any flames on the person or their clothing by smothering them with a blanket or using water.<br><br>
        
        2. *Cool the Burn*: Immediately cool the burned area with cool (not cold) running water for at least 10-20 minutes. This helps to reduce the severity of the burn and relieve pain. Avoid using ice or ice-cold water as it can further damage the skin.<br><br>
        
        3. *Remove Clothing and Jewelry*: If clothing or jewelry is not stuck to the burn, carefully remove them to prevent further injury. However, if clothing is stuck to the burn, do not attempt to remove it; leave it in place and seek medical help.<br><br>
        
        4. *Cover the Burn*: After cooling the burn, cover it loosely with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth to protect it from infection. Avoid applying any ointments or creams to the burn as they can trap heat and increase the risk of infection.<br><br>
        
        5. *Elevate the Burned Area (if Possible)*: If the burned area is on a limb and it's practical to do so without causing further harm, elevate the affected limb to reduce swelling.<br><br>
        
        6. *Provide Pain Relief*: If the person is in pain, you can give over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, following the recommended dosage instructions.<br><br>
        
        7. *Seek Medical Attention*: Even if the burn seems minor, it's important to seek medical attention for severe burns. Burns covering a large area of the body, burns on the face, hands, feet, or genitals, or burns caused by chemicals, electricity, or inhalation should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.<br><br>
        
        8. *Monitor for Shock*: Keep an eye out for signs of shock, such as pale, clammy skin, rapid breathing, and confusion. If you suspect the person is going into shock, lay them down with their feet elevated and cover them with a blanket, but do not give them anything to eat or drink.<br><br>
        
        9. *Do Not Break Blisters*: If blisters form on the burn, do not break them as this can increase the risk of infection.<br><br>
        
        Remember, prompt and appropriate first aid can help minimize the severity of burns and improve outcomes. Always prioritize seeking medical attention for severe burns to ensure proper treatment and prevention of complications.<br><br>
