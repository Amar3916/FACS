   <h1> Both hypothermia (excessive cold) and heat stroke (excessive heat) are serious medical conditions that require prompt attention. Here's what to do in each situation:</h1>

<h1>*Hypothermia:*</h1><br><br>

<br><br>
1. *Move to a Warm Location*: If possible, move the person to a warmer place indoors or sheltered from the cold, wind, and precipitation.<br><br>

2. *Remove Wet Clothing*: Remove any wet clothing and replace them with dry, warm layers. Cover the person's head with a hat and cover their body with blankets or warm clothing.<br><br>

3. *Warm the Person Gradually*: Use blankets, towels, or even your own body heat to gradually warm the person. Avoid using direct heat sources like hot water bottles or heating pads, as they can cause burns.<br><br>

4. *Offer Warm, Non-Alcoholic Drinks*: If the person is conscious and able to swallow, offer them warm, non-alcoholic beverages to help raise their body temperature.<br><br>

5. *Monitor Vital Signs*: Keep a close eye on the person's vital signs, including breathing and pulse. If their condition worsens, or if they lose consciousness, seek emergency medical help immediately.<br><br>

<h1>*Heat Stroke:*</h1>

1. *Move to a Cooler Place*: If the person is experiencing heat stroke, move them to a cooler, shaded area away from direct sunlight.<br><br>

2. *Cool the Person Down*: Lower the person's body temperature by applying cool, wet cloths or towels to their skin and fanning them to promote evaporation. If possible, immerse them in cool water or apply ice packs to the armpits, groin, neck, and back.<br><br>

3. *Encourage Hydration*: Offer the person cool, non-alcoholic beverages to drink if they are conscious and able to swallow. Avoid giving them caffeinated or alcoholic beverages, as these can worsen dehydration.<br><br>

4. *Monitor Vital Signs*: Keep a close eye on the person's vital signs, including breathing and pulse. If their condition deteriorates, or if they lose consciousness, seek emergency medical help immediately.<br><br>

5. *Prevent Reheating*: Do not let the person become overheated again after cooling them down. Continue to monitor their temperature and keep them cool until medical help arrives.<br><br>

In both cases, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly, especially if the person's condition does not improve or if they lose consciousness. Hypothermia and heat stroke can both be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.<br><br>
