    <h2>TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS KINDLY PRESS ON SITUATIONS</h2>
    <h1 class="i">A Few Additional Tips</h1>
    <p>Staying calm and collected in an emergency isn’t easy, especially if you lack professional knowledge and experience. Still,
         it is important to try and maintain your composure. Focusing on the sequence of first aid steps will simplify the process,
          allowing you to concentrate and offer sufficient and appropriate help.<br>

        One final thing to remember is that you should always prioritise your own safety, no matter how dire the situation is. If you believe there’s any risk involved, stay back. It’s much better for an emergency team to handle one situation than to address the original emergency and the injuries that would-be rescuers have also sustained.</p>
